Welcome to "Github-user-repo-stars" application.

This application can provide a list of all repositories for a user if
given their name and additionally provide a sum of all the stars the
user was awarded for their repositories.

The application is operational as it is already hosted on Heroku server. :)

The application can be developed further by extending the scope of its functionalities: <br>
- fetch more data about a user's repositories than just the name and the number of stars, e.g: <br>
  * provide a custom description of every repository by combining it's description with the size, language, etc,
  * provide a link to every listed repository,
  * based on dates of repositories' creation, analise a trend of the creator's working habit,
  * given the number of stars and the creation time, establish what was "the best" moment of the author's coding time.
- yield the results in an ascending or descending order given the number of stars, <br>

Or by implementing a more advanced front-end technology to represent the data provided by the API,
e.g. by utilizing JavaScript's capabilities in addition to HTML and CSS with data being delivered
by Thymeleaf.
